## Determine Business Objectives

### Background

We are a team of students trying to predict WBNA basketball results. WBNA (Woman's National Basketball Association) is a domestic basketball league hosted in the United States that features 12 different teams. Each season, 8 teams qualify for the **playoffs** - the final round of matchups to determine the champion.

### Business Objectives

The main objective of this project is accurately predict which teams will qualify for the WNBA playoffs in the next season based on the provided data.

This data has been collected through the past decade, and it congregates information on the players, teams, coaches and winning-awards for each season.

### Business Success Criteria

We'd hope to consistently predict atleast 6 out of 8 teams that reach the playoffs, resulting in a optimistic success rate of $A(M) \ge 75$ percent regarding our model.

## Assess Situation

### Inventory of Resources
The team is made of 3 students from the M.EIC degree in University of Porto. Each possesses their own laptop to further research on the topics related to the problem. There is a dataset with information on the last 10 WNBA seasons.

### Requirements, assumptions and constraints

The model must be ready within 12 weeks and the team is aiming for a success rate of 75 percent, as mentioned before. The team is limited by the computing power offered by Google Services (like Google Colab) and their own hardware.

### Risks and contingencies

Worst case scenario, the project might be delayed in the event of the University scheduling multiple exams near the date of submission.

### Terminology
The following terms will be used in the context of this project:
| Terminology | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| NN | Neural Network|
| TF | Tensor Flow |
| MLP | Multi-Layer Perceptron|

### Cost and benefits
The project has 0 monetary costs associated, as its being done for free, for educational purposes. That means profit is surely guaranteed. From a business standpoint, one could use this model to gamble their way into accurately predicting next year's playoffs bracket - generating money, most probably.
